    <p>
      GIT is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track
      of your source code history. It is a distributed version control system
      which means that the code is stored in a central server and the developers
      have a local copy of the code. This allows the developers to work on the
      code offline and then push the changes to the central server when they are
      ready.
