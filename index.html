    <h1>GIT CLI Feat Branch</h1>
    <p>
      GIT is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track
      of your source code history. It is a distributed version control system
      which means that the code is stored in a central server and the developers
      have a local copy of the code. This allows the developers to work on the
      code offline and then push the changes to the central server when they are
      ready.

      GIT has many features that make it a powerful tool for managing source
      code. One of the key features of GIT is branching. Branching allows you to
      create a separate line of development that is independent of the main code
      base. This allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without
      affecting the main code base. Once you are done with the changes, you can
      merge the branch back into the main code base.

      In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a new branch in GIT, make
      changes to the code, and then merge the changes back into the main code
      base. We will also learn how to resolve conflicts that may arise during
      the merge process.

      To create a new branch in GIT, you can use the git branch command. This
      command creates a new branch but does not switch to it. To switch to the
      new branch, you can use the git checkout command. For example, to create a
      new branch called feat-branch and switch to it, you can use the following
      commands:
